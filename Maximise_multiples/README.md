# Maximise the multiples

You are given an array of n integers and two integers m and k. 
You can add any positive number to any elements of the array 
such that the total value you added doesn't exceed k.

The task is to maximise the multiples of m in the resultant array.

## Example 

Consider n=4, m=2, k=2, and arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

- Let's add 1 to arr[0], and add 1 to arr[2], then the final array is arr[]=[2,2,4,4,5].
- Now there are 4 elements which are multiples of m (=2).
